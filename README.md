# test_db-fork

This repository is a manual fork of the files at
[https://github.com/datacharmer/test_db](datacharmer/test_db).

It is a manual fork because I only need a small subset of the files in
that repository.  Also, the files have been un-SQL'd and converted
into plaintext.  The files are used to illustrate using plain shell
scripts to act as a database.  The illustration is available at
https://medium.com/galileo-onwards/an-ode-to-the-shell-6717f57afc2e.
